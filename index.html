                <p class="main-body__text">
                    With 3+ years of experience and a passion for building well-designed websites and high-quality software, I can build you what you want to see come to life. I value excellency, creativity, and efficiency. Every project deserves to be thoroughly planned, fully tested, and built for maintainability. While I can work fine on my own, being a team player is something I strive for, because teamwork is essential for creating great products. When there are areas I lack experience, I make sure I fill the gaps by learning quickly and problem-solving every step of the way. At the end of the day, I will do what it takes to go above and beyond in working hard to bring your vision to life.

                    Outside of work, I enjoy many different things. I like playing and writing music. I enjoy reading books about biblical studies and theology, philosophy, self-improvment, and some good novels. I love appreciating nature and getting some good exercise. I have fun playing some video games, especially with friends. Most of all, my favorite time is the time I get to spend with those I love, especially my lovely wife, as well as my parents and siblings, and my friends.
